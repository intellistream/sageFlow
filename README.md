## Overview

The **High Performance Streaming Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) Engine**, also known as **CANDY**, is a
cutting-edge, streaming-capable engine designed to perform real-time, high-performance approximate nearest neighbor
search tasks on continuously evolving data streams. The engine leverages a vector database system optimized for
streaming environments, enabling fast and efficient ANNS over dynamically changing datasets.

## Features

- **Real-Time Streaming Support**: Efficiently handles high-throughput streaming data.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with both data size and query load.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search**: Supports ANNS for high-dimensional data using state-of-the-art techniques.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverages GPU for significant performance improvements on large datasets.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Built to be extensible with additional modules for custom workflows and integrations.

## Key Use Cases

- **Dynamic Data Retrieval**: Suitable for scenarios where data changes rapidly, such as recommendation systems,
  personalized search, and real-time anomaly detection.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Designed to serve high-velocity streaming data analysis use cases.
- **Large-Scale Applications**: Ideal for billion-scale datasets with high throughput and low latency requirements.

## Installation

To install the ANNS engine, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intellistream/CANDY.git
cd CANDY
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- NVIDIA CUDA (for GPU acceleration)

[//]: # (Install required dependencies using `pip`:)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (pip install -r requirements.txt)

[//]: # (```)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Streaming ANNS Engine, use the following script:

[//]: # (```python)

[//]: # (from candy_engine import CandyEngine)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (# Initialize the engine with streaming data)

[//]: # (engine = CandyEngine&#40;&#41;)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (# Add vectors and query for nearest neighbors)

[//]: # (engine.add_streaming_data&#40;data_stream&#41;)

[//]: # (results = engine.query&#40;vector&#41;)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (For detailed examples, please refer to the [examples]&#40;examples&#41; directory.)

## Documentation

[//]: # (## Performance Benchmark)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (The ANNS engine has been benchmarked for high performance on large-scale datasets. Some highlights include:)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (- **Latency**: < 10 ms for querying 1M vectors.)

[//]: # (- **Throughput**: Can handle up to 100K queries per second with GPU acceleration.)

[//]: # (- **Streaming**: Supports real-time updates with minimal latency.)
