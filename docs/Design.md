Design Considerations:
- Streaming and Storage: Incoming data is treated as a stream, and as transformations (e.g., map, filter) are applied, the final result is written directly to the underlying vector storage.
- Real-time Querying: While data is being streamed and stored, users can still query the vector database in real time.
- RAG Integration: Embeddings generated by an LLM can be streamed, stored, and queried as part of the same process.
